Let us consider a general quantum state
$|\psi \rangle = \alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$
the state will always satisfy 
1) $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex number
2) $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2 = 1$
Thus,
- P(0) with a probability of $|\alpha|^2$
- P(1) with a probability of $|\beta|^2$\

Bulb will be in On State or Off State

Just before the bulb is on, Bulb can be in On state and Off state at the same time
